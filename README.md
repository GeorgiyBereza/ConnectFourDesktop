# Connect Four Game (Desktop version)
![](connect4.gif)

One of the first projects I've made during Java Developer course by JetBrains Academy.

Hopefully difference between this one and new ones will show my progress. 

Tasks:
1. Create a game board divided into cells using Java Swing library.
2. Enable the cells on the board to accept user input and place the appropriate piece based on a player's turn.
3. Make the cells in a column respond as a unit to fill the board from the bottom row.
4. Add an algorithm to check for a winner after every click and then highlight the winning cells.

To start game use ApplicationRunner
